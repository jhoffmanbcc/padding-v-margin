<h1> Learning the difference between Margins vs Padding</h1>

<p> 

Margin is on the outside of block elements while padding 
is on the inside... use margin to separate the block from 
things outside it, padding to move the contents away from 
the edges of the block. </P>

<ul>

<li> Margin - Clears an area around the border. The margin
does not have a background color, it is completely 
transparent </le>

<li> Border - A border that goes around the padding and 
content. The border is inherited from the color property
of the box </li>

<li> Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is affected by the background color of the box
Content - The content of the box, where text and images
appear. </li>

</ul>
